The Statistical Power of a Biodiversity Monitoring Program
=========================================================

This repository contains example code from a project to estimate the statistical power of a biodiversity monitoring program in Kanton Aargau, Switzerland.  I analyzed three groups of species, consisting of terrestiral snails, vascular plants and breeding birds.  I have only uploaded scripts for the analysis of the data on birds, as the scripts for the other groups are similar.  This is a large and complicated analysis, which involved the simulation of a trend in the number of species over time.  While the report itself does not fully describe the details of the simulations, these can be discerned by anyone familiar with R by examining the code include here.

A notable aspect of this work is that it make extensive use of a computation cluster running the Sun Grid Engine.  This was available at the Federal Research Institute WSL, in Birmensdorf, Switzerland.
