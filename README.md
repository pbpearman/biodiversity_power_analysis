<h1>The Statistical Power of a Biodiversity Monitoring Program</h1>

<p>This repository contains example code from a project to estimate the statistical power of a biodiversity monitoring program in Kanton Aargau, Switzerland.  I analyzed three groups of species, consisting of terrestiral snails, vascular plants and breeding birds.  I have only uploaded scripts for the analysis of the data on birds, as the scripts for the other groups are similar.</p>

<p>The draft report in English and all the associated graphics and tables are available on my Google Drive account <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5PrX6jthQFATW41NEozM1hjNkU">here</a></p>
